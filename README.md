# Virtual Coffee Open-Source

This repository serves as a resource for developers at all levels interested in learning Open Source Software best practice and methodology. We hope it can become a welcoming and educational space for developers who want to get more experience in contributing to open source projects.

This project was an organic initiative by attendees of the virtual coffee meetup who all found that the typical OSS experience is not very friendly to people unfamiliar with OSS contributions.

# What is Virtual Coffee?

Virtual Coffee is a bi-weekly online meetup where developers of all types, backgrounds, and experience meet up to discuss basically anything and everything so they can learn and grow from each other's experiences. The path of a software developer can often be arduous and uncertain and having a community of peers to interact with can help all of us grow as competent and confident engineers.

# Features

As of right now, this repo is simply a hosting place for resources and examples, starting with this README, which will eventually serve as an example for well, a good README. Our contributors may decide to add accompanying web platform functionality in the future.

# Contributing

Being able to contribute is one of the core reasons the Virtual Coffee folks wanted to create this space.
